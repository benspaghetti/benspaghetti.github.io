It is funny writing this after my first week at UBC, but here we are. It is clear that this blog has gotten increasingly unhinged. Some divine power must have seen this and thought I was too cocky and gave me a complete failure of a summer.

I did a course on probability for engineers, I failed miserably. I did a UROP project, I failed miserably. 

I am at the zeroth step of research: finding a good problem. This is difficult, especially if you are only an undergrad. You have to develop your own expertise and background on the literature and then develop your own research 'programme'. But since I am a lazy POS, this has not been achieved in the slightest. 

I do have one or two ideas, let's see how much I can develop them in the coming months in Vancouver.
