Third blog post within one week! By the way I love post-midterm UST. The campus is a lot more empty.

It is more than a week after my last midterm (Honors Real Analysis) has ended. Now that I am only taking 18 credits, my grades are much better. I will be trying for three A+s this term (although only confident in one).

The person who taught me percolation has agreed to supervise my Guided Study on Research II and we are still discussing the details of the logistics. If this term is analysis-themed, 2025 Spring would be almost entirely focused on mathematics related to conformal field theory (I have no idea what that is but I think I should learn about it.) 

I am still debating the topic for UROP next term. I am unsure of what area I would like to go into and the knowledge required for each of them differs wildly. I mean if I actually want to read Miller and Sheffield's Imaginary Geometry then I definitely need Riemannian geometry. Well, I probabily need it anyway as long as I want to do random geometry. As a consequence, I am also unsure of where to go for exchange. ARRRGGGHHH! I guess I need to talk to more people, including people outside UST.

It does seem like people working in statistical physics and random geometry are indeed capable of producing work spanning many subfields though. So maybe I should just pick one and dive deep? But which one? Again, no idea :clown:.
