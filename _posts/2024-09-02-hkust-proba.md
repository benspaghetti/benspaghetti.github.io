Just a post to provide some information. As one might have noticed, Prof. Bao has left HKUST to join HKU starting from this academic year. Fortunately, Prof. Nitzschner has joined us last year, so things are still (barely) functioning. Why 'barely'?

At Prof. Nitzschner's MATH5411 lecture today, he has mentioned that next term will not feature any advanced pure probability courses, such as Stochastic Processes and Advanced Probability Theory II. They *may* be offered in Fall next year, at HKUST or other universities in Hong Kong...

No idea what to do now.
