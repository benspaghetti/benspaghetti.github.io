I don't really have much to write. Disinterested in most of my courses at UBC after midterm. Didn't get a good GPA (probably because I only took courses 'for culture'). Didn't socialise at all. Vancouver is very nice except it rains way too much so it is not nice. 

At least I have something (a lot of things) to do next term.

Went to Toronto and Montreal as well. Montreal is pretty good except it's too cold so it's not good. Toronto is just not very good. Probably go to grave without coming back to Canada again. Well, maybe return to PIMS for summer school. Summer Vancouver should be fabulous. 

I don't know what to do with this blog. Maybe I will write some [Cream Soda](https://www.peasantmaths.com/posts/cream-soda/) type thing. I don't think writing maths on here is a very good use of my time. Move to my personal website for notes.
